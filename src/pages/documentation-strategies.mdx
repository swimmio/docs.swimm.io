# The Four Main Documentation Strategies - Explained

Clients frequently ask us for advice on how to approach their documentation
workflows. These aren't really questions about the inner workings of Swimm's
components, but are more along the lines of figuring out how to focus their
writing efforts. 

We suggest thinking of it more as a *strategy* than an absolute plan on who
is going to write what, and when. There are four main themes that go into a 
documentation strategy.

:::tip Most Strategies Are A Combination Of These Approaches:

<Tabs
    defaultValue="ff"
    values={[
        {label: 'Firefighting', value: 'ff'},
        {label: 'Breadth-first', value: 'bf'},
        {label: 'Depth-first', value: 'df'},
        {label: 'Task-oriented', value: 'to'}
    ]}>
    <TabItem value="ff">
        Firefighting involves creating the level of documentation appropropriate
        for the area of the code as needed to answer questions as they arise.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="bf">
        Breadth-first means writing sparsely about as many things as possible. Brevity
        gives us a little bit of coverage essentially everywhere.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="df">
        Depth-first means writing a lot about a single, or very few things. We'll have
        a small part of the code base documented extensively. 
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="to">
        Task-oriented means a procedural tutorial to accomplish a specific thing. New
        developers will know what dependencies to install and how to run a build.
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::

Most new codebases begin with a firefighting strategy coupled with some task-oriented
guides to help new contributors set up and accomplish common things. Code that lacks
documentation might benefit from a breadth-first pass and then firefighting as needed.

Customer-facing documentation generally requires a depth-first/breadth-second combo.
But, whatever you do, it's likely going to be a combination of two or more of these.

You can read a more in-depth discussion of how these approaches go into an overall
documentation strategy [in our blog post about documentation strategies.](https://swimm.io/blog/).
