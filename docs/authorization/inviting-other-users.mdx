# Inviting Other Colleagues To Use Swimm

In your main <Link to="/docs/creating-content/workspaces">workspace</Link> menu, you'll see the following
prompt at the top-right of the screen:

![Workspace Invite](../../static/img/swimm-invite.png)
## What email should I use to invite my team?

In most cases, you want to invite your team with their work (or organizational) email address. They'll receive a link
to the workspace where we'll prompt them to log in with Google or with a combination of email and password. 

## What if they don't receive the invitation?

If a team member cannot find the Swimm invite in their inbox, make sure they check their spam folder first. You can also cancel the pending invitation by deleting it and then only after that, sending another invite.  

If you need additional assistance, please reach out to support.
